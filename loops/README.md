# Chapter 5: Python Loops

## Task 1: Loop through a List and Modify Elements
### Problem:
Create a list of integers: `[3, 7, 1, 9, 4]`.
Use a `for` loop to iterate through the list and:
- Multiply each number by 3.
- Replace numbers greater than 15 with `'Too large'`.
- Print the modified list after the loop.

#### Example Output:
```
[9, 21, 3, 'Too large', 12]
```
Consider checking the built-in `enumerate` function.

## Task 2: Sum of Even Numbers in a List
### Problem:
- Create a list of integers: `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 11, 17, 22]`.
- Use a `for` loop to iterate through the list and calculate the sum of only the even numbers.
- Print the sum of even numbers and how many even numbers were found.

#### Example Output:
```
Sum of even numbers: 172
Number of even numbers: 6
```

---

## Task 3: Loop through a Range with Step
### Problem:
- Use a `for` loop with `range()` to print every third number between 10 and 30 (inclusive).
- After printing the numbers, print the sum of these numbers.

#### Example Output:
```
10
13
16
19
22
25
28
Sum: 133
```

## Task 4: Nested Loops for Matrix Printing
### Problem:
Create a 2D list (matrix) representing a grid of numbers:
```python
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
```
- Use a nested `for` loop to print each row in the matrix on a new line.
- Modify the program to sum the values in each row and print the sum after each row.

#### Example Output:
```
Row: [1, 2, 3] Sum: 6
Row: [4, 5, 6] Sum: 15
Row: [7, 8, 9] Sum: 24
```

---

## Task 5: Reverse List and Print Indices
### Problem:
- Create a list of strings: `['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']`.
- Use a loop to:
    - Reverse the list **without using the `reverse()` function**.
    - Print each element along with its index in the reversed list.

#### Example Output:
```
Index 0: elderberry
Index 1: date
Index 2: cherry
Index 3: banana
Index 4: apple
```
Consider checking the built-in `enumerate` function.

## Task 6: Modify Values in a Nested List
### Problem:
You are given a nested list that represents a grid of numbers. Your task is to use nested loops to modify some of the values in the grid based on specific conditions.

#### Input:
```python
grid = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
```
#### Conditions:
- If a number is even, double its value.
- If a number is odd, replace it with `0`.

#### Expected Output:
```
[
    [0, 4, 0],
    [8, 0, 12],
    [0, 0, 0]
]
```

---

## Task 7: Modify a List Using a While Loop
### Problem:
You are given a list of integers. Use a `while` loop to iterate through the list and modify the values based on the following conditions:

#### Conditions:
- If a number is negative, set it to `0`.
- If a number is positive, double its value.
- If a number is `0`, skip it without making any changes.

#### Input:
```python
numbers = [-3, 5, 0, -1, 8, 2]
```

#### Expected Output:
```
[0, 10, 0, 0, 16, 4]
```

## Bonus Task 8: Simulate a Do-While Loop in Python
### Problem:
Python does not have a built-in `do-while` loop, but you can simulate one. Write a program that repeatedly asks the user to input a number until they enter a value between `1` and `10`. Ensure the first prompt executes at least once, even if the user enters an invalid value.

#### Example Input/Output:
```
Enter a number between 1 and 10: -5
Invalid input. Try again.
Enter a number between 1 and 10: 12
Invalid input. Try again.
Enter a number between 1 and 10: 7
Thank you! Your number is 7.
```

### Hint for Implementation:
- Use an **infinite `while True` loop** to simulate the "do" part.
- **Break the loop** when the condition is satisfied.
