# Chapter 3: Control flows and logical operator

## **Tasks**

### **Task 1: Number Range Checker**
**Problem:** Write a program that:
1. Asks the user to enter a number.
2. Checks if the number is:
   - Less than `10`.
   - Between `10` and `20` (inclusive).
   - Greater than `20`.
3. Prints an appropriate message based on the conditions.

**Example Output:**
```python
Enter a number: 15
Output: The number is between 10 and 20.
```

### **Task 2: Password Validator**
**Problem:** Create a program that:
- Asks the user to enter a password.
- Checks if the password meets the following criteria:
- At least 8 characters long.
- Contains the word "Python".
- Does not contain any spaces.
- Prints whether the password is valid or not, and if invalid, specifies why.

**Example Output:**
```python
Enter password: Python123
Output: Password is valid.

Enter password: Py thon
Output: Password is invalid. Reason: Contains spaces.

```

### **Task 3: Logical Operator Practice**
**Problem:** Given three boolean variables, `a = True`, `b = False`, `c = True`, write a program that:

1. Evaluates and prints the result of the following conditions:
`a and b`
`a or b`
`not b`
`(a and c) or b`
`a and (b or c)`
2. Explain in a comment why each result is `True` or `False`.

### **Task 4: Leap Year Checker**
**Problem:** Write a program that:
1. Asks the user to enter a year.
2. Checks if the year is a leap year using the following conditions:
    - A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.
3. Prints whether the year is a leap year or not.

**Example Output:**
```python
Enter a year: 2024
Output: 2024 is a leap year.

Enter a year: 1900
Output: 1900 is not a leap year.
```

### **Task 5: Check if a Number is Even or Odd**
**Problem:** 
1. Write a program that asks the user to input a number.
2. Use a ternary operator to determine if the number is even or odd.
3. Print `"Even"` if the number is even, otherwise print `"Odd"`.

**Example Input/Output:**
```python
Input: 7
Output: Odd
```

### **Task 6: Nested Ternary for Temperature Description**
**Problem:**
1. Create a variable temperature and assign a value to it.
2. Use a nested ternary operator to classify the temperature as:
    - "Cold" if it's less than 15.
    - "Warm" if it's between 15 and 30 (inclusive).
    - "Hot" if it's greater than 30.
3. Print the classification.

**Example Output:**
```python
temperature = 22
Output: Warm
```
