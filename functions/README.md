## Task 1: String Manipulation Function
Problem:
Write a function format_name(name, title="Mr./Ms.") that takes two parameters:
- name: a string representing a person's name.
- title: a string with a default value of "Mr./Ms.".

The function should return a formatted string like: "Title: [title], Name: [name]".
The function should handle cases where name is a single name (like "Alice") or a full name (like "Alice Johnson"). If the name consists of more than one word, only the first word should be considered as the first name.

**Example Output:**
```
Title: Mr., Name: Alice
Title: Dr., Name: John
```

## Task 2: Function with Multiple Return Values
Problem:
Write a function min_max_avg(numbers) that takes a list of numbers as an argument.
The function should return three values:
- The minimum value in the list.
- The maximum value in the list.
- The average of the numbers.

Ensure that the function handles edge cases where the list is empty or has only one number.

**Example Output:**
```
Min: 1, Max: 9, Average: 5.0

Edge Case Example (empty list):
Min: None, Max: None, Average: None
```

## Task 3: Recursive Function to Calculate Factorial
Problem:
Write a recursive function factorial(n) that calculates the factorial of a number n (i.e., n!).
The function should return 1 when n is 0 or 1, and recursively multiply the number by the factorial of n-1 for values greater than 1.
Call the function with different values for n (e.g., 5, 6, 7).

**Example Output:**
```
5! = 120
6! = 720
7! = 5040
```

---

## Task 4: Function with Keyword Arguments and Validation
Problem:
Write a function create_user(username, email, password, **kwargs) that:
- Takes username, email, and password as required parameters.
- Accepts any additional user details through **kwargs (e.g., age, address).

Validate that:
- The username is at least 5 characters long.
- The email contains @.
- The password is at least 8 characters long.

Return a dictionary with the user details if validation is successful, or an error message if validation fails.

**Example Output (valid input):**
```
{'username': 'john123', 'email': 'john@example.com', 'password': 'securePass123', 'age': 30}
```
**Example Output (invalid input):**
```
"Error: Username must be at least 5 characters, email must contain '@', and password must be at least 8 characters long."
```

## Task 5: Calculate the Square of a Number
Problem:
Write a lambda function to calculate the square of a given number.

**Expected Output Examples:**
```
square(4)   # Output: 16
square(-3)  # Output: 9
square(0)   # Output: 0
```

---

## Task 6: Find the Larger of Two Numbers
Problem:
Write a lambda function to compare two numbers and return the larger one.

**Expected Output Examples:**
```
larger(10, 20)   # Output: 20
larger(-5, -10)  # Output: -5
larger(8, 8)     # Output: 8
```

---

## Task 7: Combine Names with Their Lengths (map and lambda)
Problem:
You are given a list of names. Use a lambda function and map to create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name and its length.

**Input:**
```
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[("Alice", 5), ("Bob", 3), ("Charlie", 7)]
```

---

## Task 8: Extract Words Starting with a Specific Letter (filter and lambda)
Problem:
You are given a list of words and a target letter. Use a lambda function and filter to create a new list containing only the words that start with the given letter.

**Input:**
```
words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apricot", "blueberry"]
target_letter = "a"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
["apple", "apricot"]
```

---

## Task 9: Create a Running Total (reduce and lambda)
Problem:
You are given a list of numbers. Use a lambda function and reduce to create a single list that represents a running total.

**Input:**
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[1, 3, 6, 10]
```

---

## Task 10: Chain map and filter
Problem:
You are given a list of integers. Use lambda, map, and filter together to first double each number, then filter out the numbers that are greater than 10.

**Input:**
```
numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[4, 8, 12]
```

---

## Task 11: Generate a Sequence of Squares
Problem:
Write a generator function called generate_squares that yields the squares of numbers starting from 1 up to a given number n (inclusive).
Use a for loop and the yield keyword to create the generator.
Test the generator by iterating through it and printing the values.

**Example Input:**
```
for square in generate_squares(5):
    print(square)
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
4
9
16
25
```

**Challenge:**
```
sum(generate_squares(4)) should return 30.
```

## Task 12: Generate Infinite Prime Numbers
Problem:
Write a generator function called generate_primes that yields prime numbers indefinitely.
Use a while loop to check for prime numbers.
Test the generator by printing the first 10 prime numbers using a for loop and enumerate.

**Example Input:**
```
primes = generate_primes()
for i, prime in enumerate(primes):
    if i >= 10:  # Stop after 10 primes
        break
    print(prime)
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
3
5
7
11
13
17
19
23
29
```
